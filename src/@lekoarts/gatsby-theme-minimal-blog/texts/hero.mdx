<h3 style={{ fontSize: '2rem' }}>Hi.</h3>

I'm Jafar Rezaei (SayJeyHi) - currently I Frontend team lead at <a href="http://hoory.com" target="_blank">Hoory</a> AI assistant team. I love javascript/typescript, and I also like teaching to other people. That's why I wrote two books to make learning javascript and reactjs easier,
it is open source and available in <a href="http://mariotek.ir" target="_blank">Mariotek</a> repository [ <a href="https://github.com/Mariotek/BetterUnderstandingOfJavascript" target="_blank">github</a> ]. I also translate a book about reactjs interview questions which could help people to have easier interviews [ <a href="https://github.com/Mariotek/reactjs-persian-interview-questions" target="blacnk">github</a> ].
